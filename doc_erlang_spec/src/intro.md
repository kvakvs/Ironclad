# Introduction

This is a partial language syntax and semantic specification for the Erlang language and the
preprocessor. It captures the details on what each piece of a parsed source file means and how it is
to be treated by the implementation of a parser and a compiler.

This file is not an officially recognized specification or guide, and not created or supported by
the Ericsson's OTP team which currently develops and runs the Erlang/OTP project, but may serve as a
starting point if one was to be created.

This book will capture the implementation of Ironclad parsers and other systems, and will try to
link to corresponding Erlang documentation paragraphs to avoid duplicating the data.
